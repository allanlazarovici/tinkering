There are N objects kept in a row. The ith object is at position
x_i. You want to partition them into K groups. You want to move all
objects belonging to the same group to the same position. Objects in
two different groups may be placed at the same position. What is the
minimum total amount by which you need to move the objects to
accomplish this?

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases
follow. The first line contains N and K. The next line contains N
space seperated integers, denoting the original positions x_i of the
objects.

Output:
Output T lines, containing the total minimum amount by which the
objects should be moved.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= K <= N <= 200
0 <= x_i <= 1000

Sample Input:
3
3 3
1 1 3
3 2
1 2 4
4 2
1 2 5 7

Sample Output:
0
1
3

Explanation:

For the first case, there is no need to move any object.
For the second case, group objects 1 and 2 together by moving the
first object to position 2.
For the third case, group objects 1 and 2 together by moving the first
object to position 2 and group objects 3 and 4 together by moving
object 3 to position 7. Thus the answer is 1 + 2 = 3.
